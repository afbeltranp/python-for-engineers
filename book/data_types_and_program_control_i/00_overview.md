# Data Types and Program Control I

This week will be on Conditionals, Loops, and Lists!

---

## What to Expect from this Module

In this module we will go over the three main things.
- **Conditionals:**
  - How if statements/boolean expressions work in python.
  - Logical operators to use on booleans.
- **Loops:**
  - While loop basics.
  - For loops.
- **Lists:**
  - Basic lists and range.
  - Min and max built-in functions.
  - Nested lists.

---

### 1. **Conditional Statements**

- Understand how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in Python for decision-making.

---

### 2. **Logical Operators**

- Understand how to use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) in Python.

---

### 3. **While loops**

- Learn how to implement and control loops using **conditional statements**.

---

### 4. **List and Range**

- Learn how to use the **range()** function to generate sequences of numbers.
- Demonstrate **list indexing** and **slicing** using positions.

---

### 5. **For loops**

- Understand how to use **for loops** in Python to iterate over sequences.
- Learn how to loop through **lists**, **strings**, and use the **range()** function.

---

### 6. **Min and Max Python**

- Learn how to use Python's **`min()`** and **`max()`** functions to efficiently find the smallest and largest values.

---

### 7. **Nested lists**

- Understand how to access and modify elements in a 2D list.
- Use nested loops to iterate through 2D lists.

---

### 8. **Overall Demo**

- A programming question testing all of the above topics.
  - This will be a weekly occurrence.
